# Milestone 1: Problem Identification

**Date:** November 30, 2024  
**Researcher:** Safa Saber

## Objective
Develop a well-researched problem statement and actionable research question(s).

## Research Question
**"How does age at first marriage in Asia compare to global patterns, and what do gender differences reveal about regional diversity?"**

## What I Did

### Background Research
- Studied existing literature on marriage age patterns globally
- Researched why marriage age matters: gender equality, education access, economic development
- Identified Asia's diversity: traditional societies to ultra-modern economies
- Explored demographic trends and social indicators

### Scope Definition
- **Coverage:** 192 countries across 5 continents
- **Focus:** Asia (48 countries) with global comparisons
- **Variables:** Men's age, women's age, average age, gender gap
- **Approach:** Descriptive statistics and comparative analysis

### Domain Study
Created comprehensive domain study documentation:
- Why marriage age is a meaningful indicator
- Global patterns (developed vs developing nations)
- Asia-specific context and diversity
- Data sources and research methodology
- Key stakeholders and terminology

## Deliverables Completed
✅ Well-researched problem statement  
✅ Actionable research questions  
✅ Domain study documentation (0_domain_study/README.md)  
✅ Literature review and context established
