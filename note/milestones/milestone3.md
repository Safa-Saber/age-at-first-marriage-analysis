**Date:** December 3-4, 2024  
**Researcher:** Safa Saber

## Objective
Conduct data analysis and create a non-technical summary.

## What I Did

### Statistical Analysis
**Calculated for Asia:**
- Mean: Men 28.69 years, Women 25.68 years, Average 27.20 years
- Median: Men 28.6 years, Women 25.45 years
- Mode: Men 27.2 years, Women 21.0 years
- Standard Deviation: Men 3.20, Women 3.42
- Variance: Men 10.23, Women 11.71
- Gender Gap: 3.01 years

**Continental Comparisons:**
- Europe: 31.81 years (highest)
- Americas: 28.90 years
- Asia: 27.20 years (3rd globally)
- Oceania: 26.34 years
- Africa: 25.34 years (lowest)

### Key Findings
- **Highest in Asia:** South Korea (38 years) - 4th globally
- **Lowest in Asia:** Nepal & Laos (21.9 years) - 6th globally
- **Diversity:** 16.1 year range within Asia
- **Gender Gaps:** Asia (3.01) between Europe (2.36) and Africa (5.01)

### Data Quality Assessment
- Analyzed data collection years (1980-2024)
- 56.25% of Asian countries have post-2018 data
- Europe has most recent data (81.82% post-2018)
- Identified temporal variations affecting comparability

### Visualizations Created
- Bar charts: Continental comparisons, country rankings
- Scatter plots: Data collection timeline, age gap analysis
- Line graphs: Gender differences by continent
- Violin plots: Age gap distribution

### Non-Technical Summary
Created accessible summary explaining:
- Research purpose in plain language
- Key findings without statistical jargon
- Real-world implications
- Data considerations

## Deliverables Completed
✅ Complete statistical analysis (Data_Analysis.ipynb)  
✅ Data visualizations (multiple charts)  
✅ Technical findings documented  
✅ Non-technical summary (nontechnical_summary.md)
