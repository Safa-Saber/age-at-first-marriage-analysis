### `Data_Analysis.ipynb`
**Purpose**: In-depth statistical analysis comparing marriage ages across continents with focus on gender differences and temporal trends.

**Analysis Components**:
- **Continental Comparisons**: Mean marriage age and age gap across all 5 continents
- **Gender Analysis**: Comparative study of marriage ages for men vs. women by region
- **Global Rankings**: Identification of countries with highest/lowest marriage ages worldwide
- **Temporal Assessment**: Analysis of data collection years and their impact on findings (1980-2024 range)
- **Statistical Metrics**: Calculation of percentages and distributions for data currency by continent

**Key Outputs**:
- Comparative visualizations (bar charts, grouped bar charts, line plots)
- Statistical summaries by continent and gender
- Data quality assessment tables

**Dataset Used**: Combined continental data from exploratory phase (192 countries)

## Key Findings Summary

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **Continental Ranking (Mean Age)** | Europe (31.81) > Americas (28.90) > Asia (27.20) > Oceania (26.34) > Africa (25.34) |
| **Continental Ranking (Age Gap)** | Africa (5.01) > Asia (3.01) > Oceania (2.96) > Americas (2.88) > Europe (2.36) |
| **Asia Gender Differences** | Men: 28.69 years, Women: 25.68 years (3.01 year gap) |
| **Data Recency (Post-2018)** | Europe: 81.82%, Asia: 56.25%, Oceania: 42.86%, Americas: 33.33%, Africa: 30.19% |
| **Global Extremes** | Lowest: Nepal/Laos (21.9 years), Highest: South Korea (38 years) |

## Research Implications
The analysis reveals significant global variation in marriage timing, influenced by economic development, education, urbanization, and cultural norms. Asia demonstrates remarkable internal diversity, containing both some of the youngest and oldest marriage ages globally.
