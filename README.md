# Age at First Marriage in Asia: A Global Comparative Study

**Research Project | MIT Emerging Talent Program**  
**Researcher:** Safa Saber  
**Project Period:** November 29 - December 6, 2024

---

## Project Overview

This research project explores marriage age patterns across 192 countries, examining how Asia's diverse nations compare with global trends. Through data collection, statistical analysis, and visualization, this study reveals significant variations in marriage timing and gender differences that reflect broader social, economic, and cultural factors.

### Research Question
*"How does age at first marriage in Asia compare to global patterns, and what do gender differences reveal about regional diversity?"*

---

## Why This Research Matters

Marriage age is a critical demographic indicator that reflects:
- **Gender Equality:** Later marriage often correlates with improved women's rights and opportunities
- **Education Access:** Delayed marriage allows more time for schooling, especially for women
- **Economic Development:** Wealthier nations typically show later marriage ages
- **Social Progress:** Marriage timing reflects broader societal modernization and changing values

Understanding these patterns helps inform policies on education, gender equality, and social development.

## What I Did

### 1. Problem Identification
- Defined clear research questions
- Conducted background research on global marriage patterns
- Identified Asia's unique position: containing both youngest (Nepal/Laos) and oldest (South Korea) marriage ages globally
- Created comprehensive domain study documenting existing knowledge

### 2. Data Collection
- Web scraped marriage age data from Wikipedia for 192 countries
- Organized data by 5 continents (Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, Oceania)
- Cleaned and standardized datasets
- Exported 5 continent-specific CSV files

### 3. Data Analysis
- Calculated descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance)
- Compared Asia with other continents
- Analyzed gender gaps across regions
- Identified outliers and patterns
- Created multiple visualizations

### 4. Communication
- Developed visual infographic for diverse audiences
- Created non-technical summary accessible to general public
- Documented methodology for research replication
- Prepared presentation materials

## Key Findings

### Asia's Global Position
- **Average Marriage Age:** 27.20 years (3rd globally)
- **Men:** 28.69 years | **Women:** 25.68 years
- **Gender Gap:** 3.01 years (moderate compared to Europe 2.36 and Africa 5.01)

### Continental Rankings
1. **Europe:** 31.81 years (highest)
2. **Americas:** 28.90 years
3. **Asia:** 27.20 years
4. **Oceania:** 26.34 years
5. **Africa:** 25.34 years (lowest)

### Asia's Remarkable Diversity
- **Highest:** South Korea (38 years) - 4th globally
- **Lowest:** Nepal & Laos (21.9 years) - 6th globally
- **Range:** 16.1 years difference within Asia
- This diversity reflects Asia's mix of traditional societies and ultra-modern economies

## Methodology

### Data Source
Wikipedia - List of Countries by Age at First Marriage

### Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** Data collection and analysis
- **Libraries:** pandas, BeautifulSoup, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy
- **Visualization:** HTML infographic, charts, graphs
- **Version Control:** GitHub

### Analysis Approach
Descriptive statistical analysis with focus on:
- Mean, median, mode calculations
- Gender gap analysis
- Continental comparisons
- Data quality assessment (collection years: 1980-2024)

---

## Project Context

This research was conducted as part of the MIT Emerging Talent Program's Collaborative Data Science Project (CDSP). The project demonstrates:
- End-to-end data science workflow
- Web scraping and data cleaning skills
- Statistical analysis capabilities
- Data visualization and communication
- Open-source research practices

---

## Key Insights

1. **Asia demonstrates extreme diversity:** From traditional societies with early marriage (Nepal, Laos) to ultra-modern economies with delayed marriage (South Korea, Japan)

2. **Gender gaps persist but vary:** Asia's 3.01 year gap is moderate globally, between Europe's minimal gap (2.36) and Africa's larger gap (5.01)

3. **Development correlates with marriage age:** Generally, wealthier and more developed nations show later marriage ages

4. **Data quality varies:** 56.25% of Asian countries have recent (post-2018) data, while collection years range from 1980-2024

---

## Limitations

- Data collection years vary by country (1980-2024)
- Definitions may differ across countries (legal vs. actual marriage)
- This is descriptive analysis, not causal research
- Small variations in data may reflect measurement differences
- Rural vs. urban differences not captured

---

## Future Research Directions

This project provides a foundation for:
- Linking marriage age data to economic indicators (GDP, education rates)
- Conducting qualitative research on reasons for marriage timing
- Analyzing policy interventions and their effectiveness
- Studying within-country regional variations
- Time series analysis of how marriage ages change over decades
