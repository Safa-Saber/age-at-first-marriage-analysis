## Project Summary
This research project investigated age at first marriage patterns across 192 countries, with a focus on Asia's diversity. Key findings include Asia ranking 3rd globally (27.20 years average), a 16.1 year range within Asia (Nepal/Laos 21.9 to South Korea 38), and a moderate gender gap of 3.01 years. The project demonstrates Asia's complex mix of traditional and modern marriage patterns, reflecting broader socioeconomic factors.
